# Django-Internship

The Django-Internship project was created during my third year in Software Engineering at the University of Phayao, Faculty of Information and Communication Technology, as part of the Year 3 graduation exam. The project's objective is to assist in tracking internship applications for Software Engineering students, allowing teachers to monitor each studentâ€™s application progress, gather relevant data, and provide support for students who may struggle to secure an internship in time.
